Introduction

In this project, we will build and evaluate the appropriate algorithms for 4 most well known sorting algorithms which are listed below:
-Insertion Sort
-Merge Sort
-Heap Sort
-Quick Sort
Our goal is to verify the claims we already made in the class regarding each algorithm’s running time.


Design & Implementation

We built these algorithms in Java, taking advantage of its object oriented features in order to make it easier for us to focus on the concept rather than the programming language technicalities.
We build a class for each of the algorithms and we made their methods static so it’s easier for the main class to call the appropriate algorithm.
The main class called Driver.java, is responsible for all the input/output interaction of our program. Initially it “reads” the digits from each of our testing files and then stores them onto a list of arrays.
